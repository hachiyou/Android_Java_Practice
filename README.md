# Android_Java_Practice

This is a practice for building Android interactive apps.
Users will be able to update the quantity, the app will update the price to reflect the change.

If quantity value is above 1, normal increment/decrement function will be call.
If the value is 0, app will prevent further decrement, but increment is allowed.
